description: "An American psychedelic 'church' is to offer a powerful hallucinogenic tea which can offer visions of other worlds - or of meeting God. For £1,000 'worshippers' will be able to sit in a teepee in Washington and trip out on ayahuasca tea - used by South American tribes for 'spiritual journeys'."
