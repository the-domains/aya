description: 'BOGOTÁ, Colombia - Among indigenous peoples from the upper Amazon in South America, views on outsiders participating in rituals involving ayahuasca - the medicinal plant and the hallucinogenic drink made from it - vary. But even those who are more welcoming believe some ayahuasca tourists diverge too far from tradition, putting themselves and others at risk.'
