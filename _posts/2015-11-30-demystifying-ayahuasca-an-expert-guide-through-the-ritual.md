description: 'Over the last decade, the Amazonian hallucinogenic brew ayahuasca has swept through the West, becoming famous for affecting powerful (and often lasting) change in people who take it. Eager Western seekers have descended on the Amazon and the high jungle of the Andes, flooding towns like Iquitos and Pucallpa with both ayahuasca tourists and shamans who serve them - along with scam artists and shady practices.'
