description: "I've heard it dozens of times: folks justify the appropriation of Native culture and the theft of sacred rites and ceremonies by saying there's no injury; that it's essentially harmless, or even beneficial. Wrong. How does redface, be it physical, mental or spiritual, aside from making a mockery of us Originals, further colonial conquest and genocide?"
