description: "A new church near Elbe is hoping to facilitate \"vision quests\" for its members through the sacramental use of hallucinogens. If successful, the church would be the first of its kind open to the public in the United States. Unsurprisingly, that mission has managed to catch the eye of the Lewis County Prosecutor's Office."
