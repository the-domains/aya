description: "Marc leads the group Ayahuasca Healings out of Washington, USA. They are offering ceremonies with ayahuasca as part of the Native American Church, which anyone can join. We talk about how Marc and his group are approaching the legal situation they find themselves in, as well as the philosophy and practice of 'oneness' and how this pertains to ayahuasca."
