description: "I grew up with Matt. We went to grade school and high school together - we've been friends for some 27 years. He was always ahead of the curve on drugs. When we were in seventh grade we went to the Eagles' Hell Freezes Over tour: Matt was happily hitting up people our parents' age for tokes as I innocently buried my nose beneath my sweatshirt."
