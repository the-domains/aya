            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Amazon leaders and academics denounce ayahuasca rituals led by outsiders</h1><p>BOGOTÁ, Colombia - Among indigenous peoples from the upper Amazon in South America, views on outsiders participating in rituals involving ayahuasca - the medicinal plant and the hallucinogenic drink made from it - vary.
