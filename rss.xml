            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Marc Shackman on Legal Ayahuasca in America</h1><p>Marc leads the group Ayahuasca Healings out of Washington, USA. They are offering ceremonies with ayahuasca as part of the Native American Church, which anyone can join.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Amazon leaders and academics denounce ayahuasca rituals led by outsiders</h1><p>BOGOTÁ, Colombia - Among indigenous peoples from the upper Amazon in South America, views on outsiders participating in rituals involving ayahuasca - the medicinal plant and the hallucinogenic drink made from it - vary.

They expect to find a wise man, almost holy, to whom they must give themselves up in order to obtain the revelation. However Shoemaker explains that some maestros take advantage of this vulnerability and manipulate the visitor for their economic benefit.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3e0bf21f64fff6560c31c1ea4a2f727b8ad4d162.jpg"></article>]]></description>
