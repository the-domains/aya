            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Psychedelic Ayahuasca Moves into the Mainstream</h1><p>I grew up with Matt. We went to grade school and high school together - we've been friends for some 27 years. He was always ahead of the curve on drugs. When we were in seventh grade we went to the Eagles' Hell Freezes Over tour: Matt was happily hitting up people our parents' age for tokes as I innocently buried my nose beneath my sweatshirt.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/20662c3a76de10b4380d19c0f07f3df49b2d9ea1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Ms. Maria Fränklin-Beentjes was 44 years old when authorities siezed 120 liters of ayahuasca from her house in the little dutch town of Zutpen on March 2 1999.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c2b7e4a7a8b74a4ab7554be2ce107f2f19fb9894.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Who or What are the DMT Entities? Theories and Musings with Mystery School in Hyperspace Author Graham St. John</h1><p>The debate surrounding the implications of the so-called "spirit molecule" continues today among explorers of all backgrounds-scientists, psychonauts, theologians, artists and festival-goers alike. A Cultural History of DMT DMT, proper name N,N- Dimethyltryptamine, also known as the " spirit molecule," and perhaps best known as the active compound in Ayahuasca, is a psychedelic compound known to induce altered states of consciousness including, bliss, oneness, transcendence, out of body experiences, and occasionally, terrifyingly deep self-realizations.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6455d7b94c2bf1dcb6ea2cdbb903d376f898c159.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Every kind of ignorance in the world all results from not realizing that our perceptions are gambles. We believe what we see and then we believe our interpretation of it, we don't even know we are making an interpretation most of the time. We think this is reality. – Robert Anton Wilson [2][3]</p>]]></description>
